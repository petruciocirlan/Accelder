The programming language's syntax is similar with that of the C programming language.

Included are the most trivial instructions (if-then[-else], while, for) along with arithmetic and boolean expressions.

Moreover, the following features are included:
*code blocks with local variables;
* functions;
* user defined data types;
* switch instruction;
* ternary operator (cond ? expr_if_true : expr_if_false);
* heap management simulation (HeapAlloc(size), HeapFree(pointer) - needs pointer type, see below;
* static and constant variables;
* break & continue (in loops);
* data types (includes pointer);
* auto keyword used at variable declaration+initialization.
