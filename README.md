The programming language's syntax is similar with that of the C programming language.

Included are the most trivial instructions (if-then[-else], while, for) along with arithmetic and boolean expressions.

Moreover, the following features are included:

## Syntax:
* [ ] code blocks with local variables;
* [X] functions;
* [ ] data types;
* [ ] static and constant variables;
* [ ] break & continue (in loops);
* [X] ternary operator (cond ? expr_if_true : expr_if_false);
* [X] auto keyword used at variable declaration+initialization.
* [ ] user defined data types;
* [ ] switch instruction;
* [ ] heap management simulation (HeapAlloc(size), HeapFree(pointer) - needs pointer type, see above;

## Semantic:
* [ ] ...

## ~~Compiler:~~
